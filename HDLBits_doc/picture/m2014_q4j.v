	// Verilog quirk: Even though the value of (x+y) includes the carry-out, (x+y) is still considered to be a 4-bit number (The max width of the two operands).
	// This is correct:
	// assign sum = (x+y);
	// But this is incorrect:
	// assign sum = {x+y};	// Concatenation operator: This discards the carry-out
